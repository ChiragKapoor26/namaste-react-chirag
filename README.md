# Features of Parcel:-

Parcel gives you the way to host your app on https

When we are writing npx parcel index.html => It will execute the bundler parcel inside index.html => Bundles the file and store the files in the dist folder and outputs are coming from the dist folder

So we don't need to push .parcel-cache and dist folder to git or production because they can be regenerated by running the command npx parcel index.html
